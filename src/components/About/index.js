      <p>
       Full Stack Developer from the UCLA coding bootcamp, during my time there I enjoyed working on a team not only building projects but also tackling problem solving challenges. <br />
       In the six months of learning many new languages in the bootcamp I implemented some of the newest technologies to build many small projects with my collegues and determined problems,<br />
        testing methods, and best practices.
       Seeking to leverage broad development experience and hands-on technical expertise in a challenging role as a Front-end Developer.

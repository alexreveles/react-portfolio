### React Portfolio ![Github License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)
  
## Description
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. I am then presented with a quick about me section describing who i am and what i do, then i showcase my projects followed by the application link for future employers to browse through my deployed projects. When clicking on contact me section, i am presented by a form where future employers are able to contact me through an email form, and finally a resume section describing my skills, any certificates and past employers.
